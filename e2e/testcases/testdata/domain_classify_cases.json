He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a \"no\" or \"yes\" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said \"yes.\" This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent.
