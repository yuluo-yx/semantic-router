# Category-Level Jailbreak Detection Example
# This example demonstrates how to configure jailbreak detection at the category level
# Different categories can have different jailbreak detection settings and thresholds based on their risk profiles

# Global jailbreak detection configuration (can be overridden per category)
prompt_guard:
  enabled: true  # Global default - can be overridden per category
  use_modernbert: false
  model_id: "models/lora_jailbreak_classifier_bert-base-uncased_model"
  threshold: 0.7  # Global default threshold - can be overridden per category
  use_cpu: true
  jailbreak_mapping_path: "models/lora_jailbreak_classifier_bert-base-uncased_model/jailbreak_type_mapping.json"

# Classifier configuration
classifier:
  category_model:
    model_id: "models/category_classifier_modernbert-base_model"
    use_modernbert: false
    threshold: 0.6
    use_cpu: true
    category_mapping_path: "models/category_classifier_modernbert-base_model/category_mapping.json"

# Usage Notes:
# =============
# 1. Global Settings:
#    - prompt_guard.enabled: Sets the default enabled/disabled for all categories
#    - prompt_guard.threshold: Sets the default detection threshold (0.0-1.0) for all categories
# 2. Category Overrides:
#    - jailbreak_enabled: Override global enabled/disabled setting per category
#    - jailbreak_threshold: Override global threshold per category
# 3. Inheritance:
#    - If jailbreak_enabled is not specified, inherits from prompt_guard.enabled
#    - If jailbreak_threshold is not specified, inherits from prompt_guard.threshold
# 4. Threshold Tuning:
#    - Higher threshold (0.8-0.95): Stricter detection, fewer false positives, may miss subtle attacks
#    - Lower threshold (0.5-0.7): More sensitive detection, catches more attacks, higher false positive rate
#    - Recommended: Start with 0.7 globally, adjust per category based on risk profile
# 5. Use Cases:
#    - High-security categories (business, customer_support): Use higher thresholds (0.8-0.9)
#    - Internal tools with code/technical content: Use lower thresholds (0.5-0.6) to reduce false positives
#    - General categories: Use global default threshold
# 6. Security Best Practices:
#    - Enable jailbreak detection by default (prompt_guard.enabled: true)
#    - Only disable or use very low thresholds for specific categories where the risk is managed differently
#    - Consider the consequences of threshold settings on a per-category basis
#    - Monitor false positive and false negative rates to tune thresholds appropriately
