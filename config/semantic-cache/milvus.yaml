# Milvus Vector Database Configuration for Semantic Cache
# This configuration file contains settings for using Milvus as the semantic cache backend.
# To use this configuration:
# 1. Set backend_type: "milvus" in your main config.yaml
# 2. Set backend_config_path: "config/semantic-cache/milvus.yaml" in your main config.yaml
# 3. Ensure Milvus server is running and accessible
# 4. Build with Milvus support: go build -tags=milvus
