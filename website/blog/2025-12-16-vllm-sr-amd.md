Over the past several months, AMD and the vLLM SR Team have been collaborating to bring vLLM Semantic Router (VSR) to AMD GPUs—not just as a performance optimization, but as a fundamental shift in how we think about AI system architecture.

AMD has been a long-term technology partner for the vLLM community, from accelerating the vLLM inference engine on AMD GPUs and ROCm™ Software to now co-building the next layer of the AI stack: intelligent routing and governance for Mixture-of-Models (MoM) systems.
