We are thrilled to announce the release of **vLLM Semantic Router v0.1, codename Iris**—our first major release that marks a transformative milestone for intelligent LLM routing. Since our experimental launch in September 2025, we've witnessed extraordinary community growth: over 600 Pull Requests merged, 300+ Issues addressed, and contributions from more than 50 outstanding engineers worldwide.

In Greek mythology, Iris (Ἶρις) served as the divine messenger who bridged the realms of gods and mortals, traveling on the arc of the rainbow to deliver messages across vast distances. This symbolism perfectly captures what vLLM Semantic Router v0.1 achieves: a bridge between users and diverse AI models, intelligently routing requests across different LLM providers and architectures.
